To setup Python environment -  Ref: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-python-3-and-set-up-a-local-programming-environment-on-centos-7
------------------------------

yum -y update	
yum -y install yum-utils
yum -y groupinstall "Development Tools"
yum -y install https://centos7.iuscommunity.org/ius-release.rpm (ius - Inline with Upstream Stable, installs the stable version of python 3.6)
yum -y install python36u
python3.6 -V
yum -y install python36u-pip  -> to install pip3.6 version
yum -y install python36u-devel  -> development package for python3.6

To create virtual environments
--------------------------------
mkdir virt_environments
cd virt_environments
python3.6 -m venv my_env  --> {venv= python command for virtual environment; my_env = custom name of the virtual environment}

Following directory structure will be available after creating my_env
bin include lib lib64 pyvenv.cfg

To Activate my_env
------------------

source my_env/bin/activate
(my_env) [root@centos1 packt_python]# pip3.6 install psutil <Install python packages within the virtual environment for testing purposes>

To deactivate - 
-------------
# deactivate

Issue encountered
=================

(myenv) [root@centos2 ~]# pip install paramiko
pip is configured with locations that require TLS/SSL, however the ssl module in Python is not available.

Installation of whois module (A Python module/library for retrieving WHOIS information of domains.)
===========================

pip3.6 install whois
(my_env) [root@centos1 environments]# python3.6 whois_example.py

None


Installation of Fabric module 
===============================
- > This is mainly used for system administration tasks (patching was done on uhura using fabric), leverages paramiko library for ssh. 

pip install Fabric3

Now create a python file (fabfile.py) that has the fabric.api package and necessary modules imported and contains the functions which fab can call. 

from fabric.api import run  ##this is the package name and module

for example - 

def hello():
    print("Hello World")

By calling # fab hello
it calls the function from fabfile.py and executes the task for us. Refer fabfile.py for other options. 


Installation  of jinja2
======================

jinja2 is a template which can render what we want from the template. 

####Example code####

from jinja2 import Template

template = Template('Hello {{ name }}!')
print(template.render(name="Saran"))


t = Template("My Favorite numbers: {% for n in range(1,10) %}{{n}}" "{% endfor %}")
print(t.render())

####Example code####


pydev can be installed in eclipse by choosing the interpreter we want.
